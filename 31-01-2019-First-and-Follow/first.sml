type RHS = Atom.atom list  (* The RHS γ of a rule A -> γ *)

(*

We have the structures AtomSet and AtomMap to represent sets and maps
of Atoms. For any type t if we want sets and maps (dictionaries) we
need an ordering structure on the elements.  We would like to create
the set structure on RHS's. For this you first need to define a
structure of signature ORD_KEY for RHS.

*)

structure RHS_KEY : ORD_KEY = struct
	(* complete this *)
    type ord_key = RHS 
    fun compare ([], []) = EQUAL
        | compare ([], _) = LESS
        | compare (_, []) = GREATER
        | compare (x :: xs, y :: ys) = 
            let 
                temp =  Atom.lexCompare(x, y)
            in
                case temp of
                    EQUAL   => compare(xs , ys)
                |   GREATER => GREATER
                |   LESS    => LESS
            end
end


(*

Use the above structure to create a set of rhs's

*)

structure RHSSet = RedBlackSetFn (RHS_KEY)

type Productions = RHSSet.set

(* The rules of the grammar are a dictionary whose keys are the symbol
   and the values are the Productions associated with the grammar.
*)

type Rules = Productions AtomMap.map


type Grammar    = { symbols : AtomSet.set, tokens : AtomSet.set, rules : Rules }
